BeamerPresenter
===============

This software provides a minimalist presenter mode for pdf presentations and more specifically beamer presentations.

You should have the same amount of page in your presesentation and in your notes pdf.

Requirements:
- Windows;
- JRE;
- `SumatraPDF.exe` registered in `PATH` environment variable;
- SumatraPDF tabs disabled.

If more than 2 SumatraPDF instances are launched after you changed the current page, close the oldest ones and keep only 2 instances.
